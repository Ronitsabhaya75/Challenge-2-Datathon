# California Homelessness Analysis Summary Report
## Executive Summary
This report summarizes the findings of a comprehensive analysis of homelessness data across California counties. Using demographic information, system performance metrics, hospital utilization data, and other sources, we've built predictive models and developed county-level insights to support targeted interventions.
## Key Findings

### Demographic Patterns
- The majority of California's homeless population is comprised of adults aged 25-54
- Notable demographic variations exist across counties, with some showing significantly higher proportions of youth or elderly homeless individuals
- Gender distribution shows a majority of male individuals experiencing homelessness statewide (approximately 60-70%)

### System Performance Trends
- Statewide total homeless counts have increased by approximately 6% from 2020 to 2023
- Emergency shelter utilization varies significantly by county, with some counties showing utilization rates below 30%
- Permanent housing placements have not kept pace with the growth in homelessness in most counties

### Hospital Utilization Patterns
- Counties with higher emergency department (ED) visits among homeless individuals tend to have larger homeless populations
- Medicaid coverage among homeless individuals varies significantly across counties, with implications for healthcare access
- Hospital utilization data reveals potential healthcare system strain in areas with high homelessness

### County Clusters
Our analysis identified 6 distinct clusters of counties with similar homelessness characteristics:

1. **Cluster 1** (9 counties): Higher invalid data proportions, lower middle-aged populations
2. **Cluster 2** (78 counties): Lower NHPI representation, lower non-binary populations, higher cisgender male proportions
3. **Cluster 3** (3 counties): Higher youth (18-24) proportions, higher unknown demographics, higher transgender populations
4. **Cluster 4** (27 counties): Higher non-binary populations, higher MENA representation, lower cisgender female proportions
5. **Cluster 5** (3 counties): Higher elderly (65+) proportions, negative composite trends
6. **Cluster 6** (12 counties): Higher unknown demographics, lower young adult (25-34) and middle-aged (45-54) proportions

### Predictive Model Insights
- The NoneType model achieved the highest predictive accuracy with an R² of nearly 1.0
- Key predictive features include:
  1. Demographic proportions (especially age distributions)
  2. Hospital utilization metrics (especially emergency department visits)
  3. Emergency shelter utilization rates
  4. Historical growth trends

- Counties with significant prediction deviations (indicating potential unmet needs):
  - Los Angeles County CoC (under-predicted by 31,364 individuals)
  - CA-600 (under-predicted by 31,364 individuals)
  - CA-600 Los Angeles City & County CoC (under-predicted by 31,364 individuals)

### 2024 Forecasts
- Most counties are projected to see modest changes in homelessness levels (±1%)
- Counties with highest projected increases:
  - Solano County CoC: 5.0% increase
  - San Diego County CoC: 5.0% increase
  - California: 5.0% increase
  - Humboldt County CoC: 5.0% increase
  - Napa County CoC: 5.0% increase

## Recommendations for Targeted Funding

   - Current homeless population: 92,818
   - Key factors: large current homeless population, vulnerability concerns

24. **San Diego County CoC**
   - Current homeless population: 22,883
   - Key factors: vulnerability concerns

30. **San Francisco CoC**
   - Current homeless population: 19,577
   - Key factors: vulnerability concerns

19. **Orange County CoC**
   - Current homeless population: 19,506
   - Key factors: vulnerability concerns

16. **Santa Clara County CoC**
   - Current homeless population: 13,909
   - Key factors: vulnerability concerns

25. **Sacramento County CoC**
   - Current homeless population: 13,045
   - Key factors: vulnerability concerns

34. **Alameda County CoC**
   - Current homeless population: 12,897
   - Key factors: vulnerability concerns

29. **Riverside County CoC**
   - Current homeless population: 11,671
   - Key factors: vulnerability concerns

43. **Fresno, Madera Counties CoC**
   - Current homeless population: 10,756
   - Key factors: vulnerability concerns

## Next Steps

1. **Deeper Demographic Analysis**: Further investigate the relationship between specific demographic subpopulations and service needs
2. **Program Effectiveness Studies**: Evaluate the effectiveness of different intervention types across county clusters
3. **Longitudinal Tracking**: Implement systems to track the impact of targeted funding on homeless population changes
4. **Data Quality Improvements**: Address data quality issues, particularly in counties with high proportions of unknown/invalid data
5. **Healthcare Partnerships**: Develop stronger partnerships with hospitals and healthcare systems to better integrate homelessness and healthcare data
6. **Coordination Strategy**: Develop coordinated strategies for counties within the same cluster to share effective practices
